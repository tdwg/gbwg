Note that in Darwin Core, according to best practices, depth is measured in water from an air-water surface, while in other media the corresponding terms are dwc:minimumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters and dwc:maximumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters, where the values would be negative for depth. Thus, for a sediment at the bottom of a lake, there would be an elevation of the lake surface, the depth of the top of the sediment in the lake, and minimum and maximum distances below the sediment surface within which a sample was taken.	The DwC term expects a verbatim input (so anything really), while MIxS expects a {float} {unit} entry in meters. Any verbatim terms in DwC are matched with relatedMatch to more prescribed terms in MIxS, as they can have free text (or any other string-based value) as syntax. 
dwc:minimumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters	Minimum Distance Above Surface in Meters	The lesser distance in a range of distance from a reference surface in the vertical direction, in meters.

Note that this competes with the MIxS:depth field allowing ranges or single points, while DwC expects only the upper depth/lower altitude limit (this could also be used to justify a broadMatch predicate). However, in this mapping we made the conscious decision to view the flipping between altitude and depth as more consequential. This is a matter of choice rather than an objective rationale.

The example offered by DwC does not include the unit 'meter' as part of the entry in the field, whereas the MIxS syntax would expect the unit to be added. The numeric/float values in the DwC fields are subsumed in / contained in the more complex alphanumeric string values (which includes the units) in the MIxS fields.

Additionally MIxS expects terms from an ontology where appropriate, for which the input would be a termLabel[termID] combination. Despite these differences, one could interchangeably use these fields to hunt for the syntactic signature of country names (i.e. words delimited by a special character or whitespace) with a tagging or NLP routine, thus suggesting this to be a closeMatch. This closeness is only on country names (thus limited to the DwC -> MIxS direction of the mapping).

The DwC example only expects one sea identifier, while MIxS expects an additional region identifier (country or sea name + specific region name). Additionally, MIxS expects terms from an ontology where appropriate, for which the input would be a termLabel[termID] combination.

As noted [in this rubric](https://github.com/tdwg/gbwg/pull/78/files#r846255765), this qualifies the terms as relatedMatch.  DwC expects a list (of undefined length) of values separated by a vertical bar space  '|', while MIxS expects two words (country or sea name + specific region name). Additionally MIxS expects terms from an ontology where appropriate, for which the input would not only be a word but a termLabel[termID] combination.
dwc:eventDate	Event Date	The date-time or interval during which an Event occurred. For occurrences, this is the date-time when the event was recorded.

In case no exact time is available, the date/time can be right truncated i.e. all of these are valid times: 2008-01-23T19:23:10+00:00; 2008-01-23T19:23:10; 2008-01-23; 2008-01; 2008; Except: 2008-01; 2008 all are ISO8601 compliant	{timestamp}	MIxS core	HumanCurated	orcid:0000-0003-1144-0290 | orcid:0000-0002-2996-719X	orcid:0000-0003-1144-0290	dwc:eventDate	dwcversion:eventDate-2020-08-12	MIXSversion:mixs_v5.xlsx	5	2022-04-08	2021-04-16	1	1	Events are semantically broader than sampling events (e.g. they could include observations too)	DwC requests compliance with ISO 8601-1:2019, so does MIxS. Note, however, that this is only a recommendation in both cases. Thus, non ISO entries may be allowed. Stricter recommendations from both standards bodies would support this mapping.
dwc:materialSampleID	Material Sample ID	An identifier for the MaterialSample (as opposed to a particular digital record of the material sample). In the absence of a persistent global unique identifier, construct one from a combination of identifiers in the record that will most closely make the materialSampleID globally unique.	 	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/MaterialSample	skos:exactMatch	has exact match	skos:exactMatch	has exact match	MIXS:0000026	source_mat_id	A unique identifier assigned to a material sample (as defined by http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/materialSampleID, and as opposed to a particular digital record of a material sample) used for extracting nucleic acids, and subsequent sequencing. The identifier can refer either to the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples. The INSDC qualifiers /specimen_voucher, /bio_material, or /culture_collection may or may not share the same value as the source_mat_id field. For instance, the /specimen_voucher qualifier and source_mat_id may both contain 'UAM:Herps:14' , referring to both the specimen voucher and sampled tissue with the same identifier. However, the /culture_collection qualifier may refer to a value from an initial culture (e.g. ATCC:11775) while source_mat_id would refer to an identifier from some derived culture from which the nucleic acids were extracted (e.g. xatc123 or ark:/2154/R2).	{text}	MIxS core	HumanCurated	orcid:0000-0003-1144-0290	orcid:0000-0003-1144-0290	dwc:materialSampleID	dwcversion:materialSampleID-2020-10-28	MIXSversion:mixs_v5.xlsx	5	2021-02-09	2021-04-16	1	1		Both expect PIDs of a sort (undefined and unrestricted as to what kind - a mix of letters, numbers, etc.). The mapping as exactMatch is further supported by the MIxS key referencing the DwC key.
dwc:associatedOrganisms	Associated Organisms	A list (concatenated and separated) of identifiers of other Organisms and their associations to this Organism.	 	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Organism	skos:broadMatch	has broad match	skos:relatedMatch	has related match	MIXS:0000028	biotic_relationship	Description of relationship(s) between the subject organism and other organism(s) it is associated with. E.g., parasite on species X; mutualist with species Y. The target organism is the subject of the relationship, and the other organism(s) is the object	[free living|parasitism|commensalism|symbiotic|mutualism]	MIxS core	HumanCurated	orcid:0000-0003-1144-0290 | orcid:0000-0002-2996-719X	orcid:0000-0003-1144-0290	dwc:associatedOrganisms	dwcversion:associatedOrganisms-2017-10-06	MIXSversion:mixs_v5.xlsx	5	2021-12-20	2021-04-16	0.5	1	The range of the MIxS examples is [free living|parasitism|commensalism|symbiotic|mutualism]. While the expectation created by the MIxS definition [parasite on species X; mutualist with species Y] would exactly match the DwC term, the examples given by MIxS do not. We‚Äôve opened an issue requesting this mismatch to be fixed on the GSC/MIxS issue tracker: https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/issues/168. Focusing on the MIxS value syntax, it seems that the MIxS term is broader than the DwC term, as the latter will be more precise in any arbitrary case. E.g. Some worm is a parasite of a clam: DwC would capture parasite of clam, while MIxS would capture parasite of. One could also capture relationships with more metadata about the assertion using the ResourceRelationship extension to Darwin Core.	Both fields accept numbers, letters, and special characters. DwC expects a list of terms and corresponding identifiers, linked with colons and both in quotation marks (quoted strings). The MIxS term expects a string (which could also include special characters and numbers - ref candidate phyla names).
dwc:samplingProtocol	Sampling Protocol	The name of, reference to, or description of the method or protocol used during an Event.	 	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Event	skos:broadMatch	has broad match	skos:relatedMatch	has related match	MIXS:0000002	samp_collect_device	The method or device employed for collecting the sample	{text}	MIxS core	HumanCurated	orcid:0000-0003-1144-0290 | orcid:0000-0002-2996-719X	orcid:0000-0003-1144-0290	dwc:samplingProtocol	dwcversion:samplingProtocol-2017-10-06	MIXSversion:mixs_v5.xlsx	5	2022-04-08	2021-04-16	1	1	dwc:samplingProtocol covers both of the concepts samp_collect_device and samp_collect_process. , however,   the MIxS samp_collect_device field can accept either a reference to a protocol or a device, making it broader than the DwC field that only accepts protocol references. Based on the examples these could also be skos:exactMatch, but we are focusing on the definition for the semantic mapping. Please also note that the information that the dwc term and the samp_mat_process capture is often captured in the method steps in the EML (metadata about the dataset, not indexed in GBIF‚Äôs case), and less in the DwC terms themselves. This influences how people will use the terms in reality.	DwC expects the name of, reference to, or description (which could also include a URI, IRI, etc.), while MIxS expects free text (or any other string-based value) as syntax. The DwC description may actively call for higher diversity of strings, the MIxS term is too loosely defined to narrow down the expected diversity of stings either. Following the same logic as with the dwC:verbatim fields, we are using relatedMatch to map the two terms to one another.
