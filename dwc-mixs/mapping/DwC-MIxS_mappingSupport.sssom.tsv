The identifier can refer either to the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples. The INSDC qualifiers /specimen_voucher, /bio_material, or /culture_collection may or may not share the same value as the source_mat_id field. For instance, the /specimen_voucher qualifier and source_mat_id may both contain 'UAM:Herps:14' , referring to both the specimen voucher and sampled tissue with the same identifier. However, the /culture_collection qualifier may refer to a value from an initial culture (e.g. ATCC:11775) while source_mat_id would refer to an identifier from some derived culture from which the nucleic acids were extracted (e.g. xatc123 or ark:/2154/R2).	{text}	MIxS core	HumanCurated	orcid:0000-0003-1144-0290	dwc:materialSampleID	dwcversion:materialSampleID-2020-10-28	MIXSversion:mixs_v5.xlsx	5	2021-02-09		Both expect a mix of letters, numbers, etc.

While the expectation created by the MIxS definition [parasite on species X; mutualist with species Y] would exactly match the DwC term, the examples given by MIxS do not. We’ve opened an issue requesting this mismatch to be fixed on the GSC/MIxS issue tracker: https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/issues/168. Focusing on the MIxS value syntax, it seems that the MIxS term is broader than the DwC term, as the latter will be more precise in any arbitrary case. E.g. Some worm is a parasite of a clam: DwC would capture parasite of clam, while MIxS would capture parasite of. One could also capture relationships with more metadata about the assertion using the ResourceRelationship extension to Darwin Core.	DwC expects a list of terms and corresponding identifiers, while MIxS only expects a list of terms

Both of these terms list both, the names of (or links to) methods, or devices (either in the definition or in the examples). Based on the examples these could be skos:exactMatch, focusing on the definition, skos:broadMatch would be appropriate. The information that this term and the samp_mat_process capture is often captured in the method steps in the EML (metadata about the dataset, not indexed in GBIF’s case), and less in the DwC terms themselves. This influences how people will use the terms in reality.	DwC expects the name of, reference to, or description (which could also include a URI, IRI, etc.), while MIxS only expects a label
dwc:samplingProtocol	Sampling Protocol	The name of, reference to, or description of the method or protocol used during an Event.	 	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Event	skos:narrowMatch	narrow match to	skos:relatedMatch	related match to	MIXS:0000016	samp_mat_process	Any processing applied to the sample during or after retrieving the sample from environment.

The object is narrower as it specifies that it has to be “after the sample was taken” vs anytime; and the “The name of, reference to, or description of the method [...]” vs a specific ontology term. The information that this term and samp_collect_device capture is often captured in the method steps in the EML (metadata about the dataset, not indexed in GBIF’s case), and less in the DwC terms themselves. This influences how people will use the terms in reality.	DwC expects the name of, reference to, or description (which could also include a URI, IRI, etc.), while MIxS expects terms from an ontology where appropriate, for which the input would not only be a word but a termLabel[termID] combination
