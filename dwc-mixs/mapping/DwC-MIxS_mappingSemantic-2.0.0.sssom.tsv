Note that in Darwin Core, according to best practices, depth is measured in water from an air-water surface, while in other media the corresponding terms are dwc:minimumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters and dwc:maximumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters, where the values would be negative for depth. Thus, for a sediment at the bottom of a lake, there would be an elevation of the lake surface, the depth of the top of the sediment in the lake, and minimum and maximum distances below the sediment surface within which a sample was taken.

However, in this mapping we made the conscious decision to view the flipping between altitude and depth as more consequential. This is a matter of choice rather than an objective rationale.

While the expectation created by the MIxS definition [parasite on species X; mutualist with species Y] would exactly match the DwC term, the examples given by MIxS do not. We‚Äôve opened an issue requesting this mismatch to be fixed on the GSC/MIxS issue tracker: https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/issues/168. Focusing on the MIxS value syntax, it seems that the MIxS term is broader than the DwC term, as the latter will be more precise in any arbitrary case. E.g. Some worm is a parasite of a clam: DwC would capture parasite of clam, while MIxS would capture parasite of. One could also capture relationships with more metadata about the assertion using the ResourceRelationship extension to Darwin Core.

Based on the examples these could also be skos:exactMatch, but we are focusing on the definition for the semantic mapping. Please also note that the information that the dwc term and the samp_mat_process capture is often captured in the method steps in the EML (metadata about the dataset, not indexed in GBIF‚Äôs case), and less in the DwC terms themselves. This influences how people will use the terms in reality.
