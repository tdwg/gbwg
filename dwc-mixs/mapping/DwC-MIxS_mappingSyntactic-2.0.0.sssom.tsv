Additionally MIxS expects terms from an ontology where appropriate, for which the input would be a termLabel[termID] combination. Despite these differences, one could interchangeably use these fields to hunt for the syntactic signature of country names (i.e. words delimited by a special character or whitespace) with a tagging or NLP routine, thus suggesting this to be a closeMatch. This closeness is only on country names (thus limited to the DwC -> MIxS direction of the mapping).

As noted [in this rubric](https://github.com/tdwg/gbwg/pull/78/files#r846255765), this qualifies the terms as relatedMatch.  DwC expects a list (of undefined length) of values separated by a vertical bar space  '|', while MIxS expects two words (country or sea name + specific region name). Additionally MIxS expects terms from an ontology where appropriate, for which the input would not only be a word but a termLabel[termID] combination

Note, however, that this is only a recommendation in both cases. Thus, non ISO entries may be allowed. Stricter recommendations from both standards bodies would support this mapping.

The mapping as exactMatch is further supported by the MIxS key referencing the DwC key.

DwC expects a list of terms and corresponding identifiers, linked with colons and both in quotation marks (quoted strings). The MIxS term expects a string (which could also include special characters and numbers - ref candidate phyla names).

The DwC description may actively call for higher diversity of strings, the MIxS term is too loosely defined to narrow down the expected diversity of stings either. Following the same logic as with the dwC:verbatim fields, we are using relatedMatch to map the two terms to one another.
